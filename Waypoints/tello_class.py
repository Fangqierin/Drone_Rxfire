'''
File with the Tello_drone class which represents tello drone objects
and saves additional information about them such as their 
location, speed, waypoints, etc. while also including the implementation
of how and where they should move
'''

'''
This class uses DYNAMICALLY generated paths: all paths are generated
as the drone flies
'''

'''
Limitations: 
1. All coordinates should be divisible by the speed * interval to reduce rounding as much
as possible
2. Drone will fly incorrectly at low speeds
3. Drone flies differently at different altitudes (higher altitudes = higher speed)
4. The speed of the program also affects drone flight
