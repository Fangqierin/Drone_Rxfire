no_cluster: 
1) coverage-based heuristic 

#NeigWPC: Choose closest neighboring WPC 
#BestCovNeigWPC:  use the coverage/distance 
#BestRewardWPC: reward/distance No Improve! 

#BestDistanceNeigWPC: use set_cover+ distance
#BestTopDownNeigWPC: use set_cover+distance, for tie, get the WPC of closest x value
#ImproveRewardWPC: same with BestRewardWPC but do not consider highest WPC

boundary: Set_cover + distance based 
top_and_down: All_WPC+ distance-based

#9/23: We Need to modify the CheckReturn for returning back at the end! 
1) Add a judgment! When do planning, change the self.endtime. 

2) I want to consider inter-time among missions. 
To do this, I added Missions into bidder, and a inter-fly time InterFly[m][m]
